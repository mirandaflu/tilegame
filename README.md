========

I saw this somewhere on the internet once, and I was not very good at solving it,
but I always have a love-hate relationship with puzzles that I'm not good at.
Eventually I lost the link to the original, but I knew it would bother me if I
never got to play it again, so I put it together here. Even after making it myself
and studying how it works, I'm still tragically bad at this puzzle, but I take
comfort in the fact that the way that I coded it makes it always solvable.
